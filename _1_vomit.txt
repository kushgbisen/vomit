need to finish the api endpoint for user authentication today, also want to apply to some job postings this week, and learn rust programming this month. should probably update my github profile and push some commits. also need to review sarah's pull request and fix that bug in the payment system. maybe start learning golang too? also should fix my sleep schedule and start exercising regularly. need to save more money and visit family more often. clean up my apartment and maintain better work life balance.
